Street to Stability – Sunday Off Update (v5)

CHANGE
------
If the player has a job, they cannot work on Sundays.

Sunday Behavior
----------------
• No work shifts available
• No missed-work penalty
• Player may:
  - Rest
  - Train (Library / Gym / Computer)
  - Do Side Gig
  - Recreation
  - Handle life maintenance (hygiene, energy)

WHY THIS HELPS
--------------
• Reduces grind and burnout
• Prevents soft-locks after job loss
• Creates a natural skill-growth day
• Matches real-world pacing expectations

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (game.js)
------------------------------
1. Track dayOfWeek (0–6), where 6 = Sunday
2. In renderActions():
     if (player.hasFastFoodJob && dayOfWeek === 6)
       → DO NOT show Work button
3. In missed-work logic:
     if (dayOfWeek === 6)
       → skip missed-work checks

This file documents logic added in v5.
